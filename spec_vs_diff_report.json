  "summary": "Both REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be implemented in the diff. The Pricing.tsx file now renders the 'Most Popular for Freelancers' and 'Best Value' badges as inline Badge components inside the PlanCard component, positioned at the top of the card content (above the icon/title row), rather than floating outside the column boundaries. The implementation uses a conditional render block with plan.highlightTag and applies distinct styling for isPopular vs isBestValue plans.",
