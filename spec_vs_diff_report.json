  "summary": "Both REQ-1 and REQ-2 are largely implemented. REQ-1 adds a Generate Invoice button in Transaction.tsx with pre-population logic and navigation to the Invoice tab. REQ-2 adds Back buttons on Transaction, Invoice, and ApiDocs tabs. The RegionSelect tab hides the Back button. One minor gap: the Transaction.tsx diff is truncated so the disabled state or tooltip for the Generate Invoice button when no calculation has been performed cannot be fully confirmed.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "If no VAT calculation has been performed yet, the button is disabled or shows a tooltip prompting the user to complete the calculation first.",
      "reason": "The Transaction.tsx diff is truncated and does not show the Generate Invoice button's UI-level disabled prop or tooltip when hasCalculated is false. The handler returns early if calculationResult is null, but no visible disabled or tooltip UI is confirmed in the diff.",
