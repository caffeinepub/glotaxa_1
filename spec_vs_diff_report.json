  "summary": "The diff implements the three core requirements: REQ-1 (3 line item rows in Transaction tab), REQ-2 (line items flow to Invoice tab with VAT rate resolution), and REQ-3 (remove item type dropdown). App.tsx correctly defines LineItemEntry, manages shared state, and passes lineItems to both Transaction and Invoice. Transaction.tsx imports VAT_CATEGORIES and renders 3 rows. Invoice.tsx receives lineItems and includes VAT rate derivation logic. However, because the Invoice.tsx diff is truncated, it is not possible to fully confirm REQ-2 display details or REQ-3 dropdown removal in the rendered JSX.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Empty/unfilled line item rows (where net amount is blank or zero) are omitted from the Invoice line items",

      "requirement": "No dropdown selector appears for Invoice Item type in the Invoice tab line items section; item description is displayed as static/read-only text",
