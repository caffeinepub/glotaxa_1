  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend/src/pages/Invoice.tsx to introduce a MAX_LINE_ITEMS = 3 constant, which is the core mechanism for REQ-1. The implementation appears to be in place structurally (constant defined, file modified), but the diff is truncated so we cannot fully verify the UI enforcement (disabled/hidden button logic). Based on available evidence, the requirement appears substantially implemented with no hallucinated features detected.",
