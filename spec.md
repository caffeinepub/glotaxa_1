# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Move the "Most Popular for Freelancers" and "Best Value" badges so they appear inside their respective plan cards on the Pricing page.

**Planned changes:**
- Move the "Most Popular for Freelancers" badge/label inside the Starter plan card (e.g., above the plan title or as an inline chip), so it is fully contained within the card boundaries.
- Move the "Best Value" badge/label inside the Pro plan card (e.g., above the plan title or as an inline chip), so it is fully contained within the card boundaries.

**User-visible outcome:** On the Pricing page, both promotional badges are displayed within their respective plan columns rather than floating outside or overlapping adjacent columns, on both desktop and mobile viewports.
