REQ-45 CSS fixes for z-index and overflow visibility have been applied in frontend/src/index.css with the exact specified values (z-index: 9999 for select, z-index: 99999 for dropdown content, overflow: visible for parent containers). REQ-46 height constraint for 3 visible items has been implemented in frontend/src/pages/Transaction.tsx using max-h-[calc(3*2.5rem)] with overflow-y-auto on the SelectContent component.",
